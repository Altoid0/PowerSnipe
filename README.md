# PowerSnipe
## Minecraft name sniper based on Powershell
PowerSniper is a name sniper created using native Windows Powershell Version 5.1, no fancy imports or dependencies needed!

## Usage
To use PowerSniper simply download the most recent [build](https://github.com/Altoid0/PowerSnipe/releases).
However, if running random builds off the internet doesn't float your boat you can always just run PoshSnipe.ps1 in a normal PowerShell window.

To do so run the following command in a PowerShell console:
`.\PoshSnipe.ps1`

All the inputs should be self explanatory except for the Bearer Token. You can obtain the Bearer Token by logging in to minecraft.net with your account and and using [EditThisCookie](http://www.editthiscookie.com) to display the token.

# Happy Sniping!
